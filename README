The GAP 4 package `SimplicialSurfaces'
==============================

To use this package, go into your local installation directory for GAP
(often located under /opt/gap* ), and clone the repository in the 
pkg/-subfolder:

cd pkg/
    git clone https://github.com/gap-packages/SimplicialSurfaces.git

You also need the following package:

    git clone https://github.com/sebasguts/AttributeScheduler.git

It is suggested that you also use the NautyTracesInterface for faster 
isomorphism checks:

    git clone https://github.com/gap-packages/NautyTracesInterface.git

To initialize it, perform the steps in the README of that package (this needs
automake and libtools and probably something else that I do not know)



Then
        LoadPackage("SimplicialSurfaces")
can be used to access the package inside a GAP session.


To create the manual you have to type
    make
in the main folder of the SimplicialSurfaces-package. This requires GAPDoc 
version >= 1.6 and AutoDoc version
>= 2017.09.15. If you don't have those, go to the folder of your local GAP 
installation and type
    cd pkg/
    git clone https://github.com/frankluebeck/GAPDoc.git
    git clone https://github.com/gap-packages/AutoDoc.git
To compile the pictures, you also need the following bash-commands:
    autoconf
    htlatex
    md5sum
    pdflatex
    sed
    

If there are any questions, don't hesitate to ask me.

If you notice any bugs, strange behaviour or want to request a feature,
please use the "Issues"-Tab on GitHub. This makes sure that your contribution
will not get lost in some mails and it makes managing the requests easier.



Have fun! :)
