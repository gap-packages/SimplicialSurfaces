##  This file contains the declaration part for the identifications of the 
##	SimplicialSurfaces package. An identification is an isomorphism between
##	two faces (and the incident vertices and edges) and is used to fold a
##	coloured simplicial surface.
##
##	An identification consists of three maps - one for vertices, edges and
##	faces. It can be applied to any simplicial surface (with colouring) where
##	it the application is well-defined.

##
##	Define a new family for identifications. The family
##	defines a necessary condition that has to be fulfilled for objects to be 
##	equal to each other. The argument IsSimplicialSurfaceIdentification 
##	guarantees that only objects that lie in this category can be part of the 
##	family.

#!	@Description
#!	Return a simplicial surface identification based on three maps.
#!
#!	The NC-version does not check whether the number of elements is correct,
#!	i.e. whether the vertex map consists of three vertices, the edge map of
#!	three edges and the face map of one face.
#!	
#!	@Arguments three bijective maps: for vertices, edges and faces
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface identification
DeclareOperation( "SimplicialSurfaceIdentification", [IsMapping and 
		IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective]);
DeclareOperation( "SimplicialSurfaceIdentificationNC", [IsMapping and 
		IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective, IsMapping and IsBijective]);

#!	@Description
#!	Return a simplicial surface identification which is constructed from three
#!	lists. The vertex-list has the form [[p_1,q_1],[p_2,q_2],[p_3,q_3]] and
#!	corresponds to the map p_i -> q_i. Analogously for the other two lists.
#!
#!	The NC-version does not check if the lists fulfill this format or if the
#!	number of elements match or if the resulting maps are bijective.
#!
#!	@Arguments three lists of tuples of positive integers
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface identification

#!	@Description
#!	Return if the given simplicial surface identification is well-defined
#!	with respect to the given simplicial surface.
#!	This method checks if the maps of the identification can be applied to
#!	the vertices, edges and faces of the simplicial surface. It also
#!	checks whether the maps are compatible with each other, i.e. if they
#!	commute with the incidence relation of the simplicial surface. This would
#!	also catch the case of an identification between two faces with different
#!	numbers of vertices.
#!
#!	This method can also be called with a coloured simplicial surface. In that
#!	case it checks whether the simplicial surface identification is well defined
#!	with respect to the underlying simplicial surface.
#!
#!	@Arguments a simplicial surface, a simplicial surface identification
#!	@Returns true or false
DeclareOperation( "IsWellDefinedIdentification", 
	[IsSimplicialSurface, IsSimplicialSurfaceIdentification] );


#!	@Description
#!	Return if the given simplicial surface identification is constant on the
#!	intersection for the given coloured simplicial surface.
#!	TODO explain what this means
#!
#!	The NC-version does not check whether the identification is well-defined
#!	with respect to the given simplicial surface. Do not call this method
#!	unless you know that the identification is well-defined!
#!
#!	@Arguments a coloured simplicial surface, a simplicial surface 
#!	identification
#!	@Returns true or false
DeclareOperation( "IsConstantOnIntersection", 
	[IsColouredSimplicialSurface, IsSimplicialSurfaceIdentification] );
DeclareOperation( "IsConstantOnIntersectionNCWellDefined", 
	[IsColouredSimplicialSurface, IsSimplicialSurfaceIdentification] );


#!	@Description
#!	Return the neighbour identification of two neighbouring faces of a
#!	(coloured) simplicial surface. By construction this identification is
#!	well-defined and constant on the intersection. If the neighbouring faces
#!	have a different number of vertices this method throws an error.
#!
#!	The NC-version does not check whether the faces really lie on the surface.
#!
#!	@Arguments a (coloured) simplicial surface, two face numbers (for a coloured
#!		simplicial surface these refer to the underlying simplicial surface).
#!	@Returns a simplicial surface identification
DeclareOperation( "NeighbourIdentification", 
	[IsSimplicialSurface, IsPosInt, IsPosInt] );
DeclareOperation( "NeighbourIdentificationNC",

#!	@Description
#!	Return if the given simplicial surface identification can be applied to
#!	the given coloured simplicial surface and result in another
#!	coloured simplicial surface. To be more precise we check the
#!	property of corollary 2.37 in my master thesis.
#!
#!	The NC-version doesn't check whether the identification is constant on
#!	the intersection.
#!
#!	@Arguments a coloured simplicial surface, a simplicial surface 
#!	identification
#!	@Returns true or false

#!	@Description
#!	Extend the equivalence relation of the coloured simplicial surface
#!	with a simplicial surface identification. If the equivalence class numbers
#!	x and y are identified, the union of these classes is labelled by the
#!	number which lies in the domain of the given identification.
#!
#!	The NC-version does not run the test IsApplicableExtension.

#!		identification
