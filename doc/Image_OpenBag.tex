    % Fill faces	
    % We use a vertical shading to make it obvious which face is in the background
    % This is important since the reader otherwise might fall prey to an optical illusion
    % and confuse front and back. Since this would change the incidence geometry, this has
    % to be avoided at all costs.
    %
    % Since the generation of svg-images does not support shadings, we will replace the
    % shading by a darker fill-in in the HTML-version.
